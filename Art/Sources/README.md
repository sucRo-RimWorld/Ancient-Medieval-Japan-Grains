> 2026-10-10: The author explicitly instructed replacement of old Grains artwork with the Astra-generated revision. The current crop/sheaf source and legacy texture files have been overwritten accordingly; historical recovery hashes below describe the superseded files, not the current files. Current exact source/target hashes and provenance are in [AstraReplacement-20261010.json](AstraReplacement-20261010.json). Generated originals retain their original resolution; immature outline-normalized high-resolution working sources are stored separately. Kernel/masu art is outside this replacement. Local installation only; GitHub publication and runtime rendering are not claimed.

> Workshop common sources moved to Project on 2026-10-08. Workshop entries below retain recovery provenance; their authoritative bytes now live at the linked Project paths.

# AMJ Authoritative Art Sources

This directory stores accepted source artwork and authoring files that must survive independently of production-resolution exports.

## Rules

- Once the author accepts an image, preserve the exact accepted source here as an **immutable master** before creating or replacing production derivatives.
- Never overwrite a source merely to make a 256×256 game texture.
- Derive production PNGs from a copy/export and write them under `Textures/`.
- Preserve the source file's original pixel dimensions, alpha, and authoring structure unless the author explicitly approves a new master.
- Keep editable authoring files such as GIMP `.xcf` files beside the corresponding rendered master when they are part of the accepted source.
- Mirror the `Textures/` relative asset path beneath `Art/Sources/` where practical so source and derivative are easy to pair.
- If an already-approved master survives elsewhere (for example a persistent reference store), migrate the **exact accepted bytes** here when that asset is next touched. Do not substitute a production-resolution derivative or regenerated approximation for a missing source.
- A source is not considered repository-preserved until the exact file is actually committed here.

## Accepted leafless millet set — 2026-10-09

Author accepted the Awa/Hie/Kibi immature and mature images and mixed millet sheaf with 「では一旦これでFixとする」. Exact built-in ImageGen originals are preserved locally under `Things/Plants/{FullGrown,Immature}/AMJC_{Awa,Hie,Kibi}_Simple/` and `Things/Item/Resource/AMJC_Millet/MixedMilletSheaf/MixedMilletSheaf.png`. Existing accepted sources remain unchanged. These exact originals are included in the 2026-10-10 GitHub integration; subsequent review revisions remain separately preserved under Art/Candidates.

Prompts, source/export hashes and mechanical QA are in `Art/Candidates/MilletSimplification-20261009/`. Exports use uniform whole-canvas BOX downsampling onto 256×256 transparent canvases; this avoids LANCZOS low-alpha ringing for these sources. Three stack slots reuse identical bytes. Species are conveyed through seed-head silhouette with no leaves or individual grain outlines. Immature is green; mature is ochre. This is the author-approved narrower millet revision; other crop/resource art is unchanged.

## Integrated crop-family source archive — 2026-10-10

Nineteen player-visible crop/sheaf graphic states (seven mature, seven immature, five bundled sheaves) are linked from [the exact-byte manifest](../../Docs/References/GrainsCropSourceManifest.json). Three already archived mature millet sources were left byte-for-byte unchanged. Sixteen new high-resolution sources are copied from committed candidate sources without re-encoding, including seven normalized-outline immature sources. The three earlier accepted Awa/Hie/Kibi immature source masters are retained under their original filenames, while current upright/outlined revisions use `*_Outline20261009.png`.

The untouched ImageGen sources, any intermediary outline edits, and final approved 256px exports remain under `Art/Candidates/ImmatureUpright-20261009/`. The high-resolution normalized immature inputs are not exact pixel derivatives of all final 256px exports because the final post-export palette pass applies. Do not substitute the old master for the latest displayed variant or silently overwrite either. Production `Textures/` and XML/patch paths already refer to the accepted outputs; game-render verification is still outstanding. `Tests/test_grains_art_source_archive.py` checks the bytes and all 19 mapped production images.

The historical 2026-10-07 14-role inventory remains a separate legacy-source recovery exercise; its 7 pending cases are not automatically closed by this newer family.

Current crop `Textures/` paths use normal `AMJC_<crop>` directory names, without `_Simple`. Paths under `Art/Sources/` retain historical source provenance, including `_Simple`-named folders; they are not a second set of active game graphics.

## Inventory / recovery queue

The complete Core source-recovery inventory is [Inventory.md](Inventory.md): 19 image roles, 12 already archived and 7 pending source verification/recovery, with 2 supplemental references counted separately. Original-file counts may differ where several assets share one source sheet. A candidate's presence does not establish final-source identity; three named immature-millet candidates were measured at 256×256 and must not be promoted to pre-resize masters. G04 now has a separately verified high-resolution original.

Do not copy a `Textures/` derivative into this tree merely to make the inventory look complete. Historical accepted assets whose exact higher-resolution/source bytes still survive elsewhere should be migrated here only from those exact bytes. If only the production derivative remains, keep that limitation explicit rather than relabeling the derivative as an original source.

Additional accepted sources should be added to the corresponding mirrored path as they are finalized or recovered.

## Workshop distribution

The repository-root `Art/` tree is development-only material and must **never** be included in Steam Workshop content.

- `.rimignore` excludes the root `Art` directory for YADA Workshop uploads.
- `.workshopignore` records the same whole-`Art/` exclusion for uploaders that support that file.
- `_PublisherPlus.xml` excludes `Art` when publishing through RimWorld's PublisherPlus workflow.
- The fail-closed publication path is `Scripts/Prepare-WorkshopContent.ps1` / `prepare-workshop.bat`, which creates a clean `git archive` staging tree and verifies that the entire `Art/` tree is absent before manual Steam publication.
- Do not publish the repository working directory through any path that bypasses these exclusions.
